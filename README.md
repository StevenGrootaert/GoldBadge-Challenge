# GoldBadge-Challenge
Steven Grootaert: Gold Badge Challenges for SD-62. When making an initial repository via github the readme file was not on my local system and caused an error with the push. git pull then push did not resolve the issue so I made a new repositiry seen here. I will try to push again to verify that this works. Same thing again - I needed to git pull origin master to DL this file (now editing on VS Studio) and will save and push origin master.
